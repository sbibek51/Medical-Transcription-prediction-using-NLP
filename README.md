NLP Project: Medical Transcription prediction


About this Project:
The main aim of the project is to predict diagnostics needed for a patient with certain diseases. The 
diseases comprise a raw text file containing a doctor's notes detailing the patient's age, free-form 
complaints, patient's medical history, and other relevant information. It lacks structure, meaning 
that sections present in one patient's diseases may be absent in another's.
The target labels consist of the necessary diagnostic procedures.
